"# phpForLoop Example" 

# Part 1

Modify the loop so that it counts up to 20. Commit and push your changes

# Part 2 

Modify the loop so that after every count of five the program puts out a line break this will mean that each group of five will be on it's own line.
**Hint** put an if statement into your loop that checks to see if the contents of the variable $i can be divided evenly by 5. i.e. the remainder (modulus) when you divide by 5 is zero.

# Part 3

Create a nested for loop which draws a five by five HTML table. The outer loop should use the variable $i as a counter(for the rows). It should increment that counter from 0 to 4. The inner loop should use the variable $j as counter(for the columns). It should also increment the counter from 0 to 4. The inner loop should draw table cells by echoing <td>$i,$j</td>.
